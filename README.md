# portfolio

<h3> Hey! I'm Em and this is the repo for my personal portfolio website! </h3>
<p> I built this on the NERD stack which I learned during my time both as a student and teaching fellow at the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy</p>
</p> I decided to pay homage to my roots of my very first HTML/CSS experience and emulate a MySpace profile from the early 2000s. I hope this website can 
both cultivate some nostalgia for my fellow millenials, as well as give you a good idea of who I am, what I can do, and how I would be an asset as a full stack engineer</p>
