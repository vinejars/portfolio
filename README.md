# portfolio

<h3> Hey! I'm Em and this is the repo for my personal portfolio website! </h3>

<p> I built this on the NERD stack which I learned during my time both as a student and teaching fellow at the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy</p>
</p> I decided to pay homage to my roots as an art teacher and make my portfolio as close to a piece of art as I could. I also wanted to add some fun animation, but remain accessible. To that end you can either fling the dots around to navigate through my website, or access a static directory via a link in the top right-hand corner./p>
