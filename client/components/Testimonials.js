           <h4><i>Em is an amazing developer to work with. They came to our project full of ideas and enthusiasm and shaped the vision 
               of the app from the start. Their creativity and engineering expertise were crucial throughout the development of our app, 
               from storyboarding to database creation to styling to AWS integration. They were always eager to jump into unknown 
               technologies and never shied away from trying something new. Em brought so much fun to the group and their contagious 
               personality made every day working together enjoyable. Their technical skills, originality, and inventiveness make them an 
               exceptional developer. I would highly recommend Em for any software engineering project! </i> </h4>
